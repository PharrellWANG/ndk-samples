Prefab Samples
==============

The samples here are to demontrate how to use [the Prefab feature] in Android Gradle Plugin.
Generally speaking, Prefab is a mechanism to make C/C++ libraries available to the gradle's
C/C++ build system, with the requirement that the C/C++ libraries are organized in the
[Prefab format] and packed inside AARs. Prefab's flow in Android Gradle Plugin, at high level,
could be viewed as:

1. Use AGP to pack C/C++ libraries (including the header files), called modules, into AAR
1. Distribute AARs with maven center or other mechanisms, but this is not Prefab specific
1. Add AAR dependency to your application, now you have access to the AAR ( but not prefab modules yet);
   again this is not Prefab specific either
1. Enable Prefab in the gradle scripts to access prefab module(s) inside AAR
1. Now you could use the Prefab modules in your app (in the source files and C/C++ build system)

Note again that the step 2 and 3 above are not C/C++ or prefab specific, please refer to
[the formal AAR documentations] for details. The rest of the steps are covered in the Prefab samples here:

* prefab-publishing is for how to create Prefab dependency into an AAR
* prefab-dependency is for how to use Prefab AARs hosted in Google Maven Center
* curl-ssl is for how to use 2 very important AARs (curl and ssl )

Prefab Availability
-------------------

Prefab has been added into Android Gradle Plugin since version 4:
* Using Prefab AARs: AGP 4.0+ (with some update in 4.1+)
* Generating Prefab AARs: AGP 4.1+

The prefab AARs used by the samples here are hosted at [Google Maven], but you could
hosting your prefab AARs anywhere accessible to gradle.

[Google Maven]: https://maven.google.com/web/index.html#com.android.ndk.thirdparty

Pre-requisites
--------------

* Android Gradle Plugin 4.0+/4.1+
* The [Android NDK](https://developer.android.com/ndk/)

Please check for the individial sample's README.md for anything specific to that sample.
